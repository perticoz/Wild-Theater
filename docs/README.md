# Wild-Theater

Wild Code School project

Guidelines :

Make a web site about new releases at the cinema theater with Boostrap 4.

There are two pages : the 'home' page and a 'film1' page that refers to the movie 'Avengers'. In the home page, the menu links are disabled, only the links to the movie 'Avengers' works.
